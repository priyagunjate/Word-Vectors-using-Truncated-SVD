# Word-Vectors-using-Truncated-SVD
Word Vectors using Truncated SVD is applied on amazon reviews datasets .From Different Types of word embedding ,here frequency based (TF_IDF word 2vec techniques ) is used. Procedure to execute the above task is as follows: Procedure: • Step1: Take Reviews data of amazon reviews data-set. And Ignore polarity column • Step2: To get Important Features using TF_IDF. • Step3: To calculate Co-occurance Matrix with Selected Important Features • Step4: To choose the n_components in truncated svd, with maximum explained variance and plotting of cumulative explained variance ratio. • Step5: To apply K-means clustering Algorithm&amp;find Best number of cluster using Elbow method • Step6: To write a Function that takes a word and returns the most similar words using cosine similarity between the vectors 1.1 Objective: • To applyWord Vectors using Truncated SVD on Amazon reviews.
